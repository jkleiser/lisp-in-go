# Implementation Notes


<a name="1"></a>
## 1. Overview

The file [lisp.go](lisp.go) is a translation of `lisp.dart` of
[lisp-in-dart](https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-dart).
For simplicity of Go, it restricts numbers to `float64` only,
while it enjoys the concurrent computations of `future` and `force` implemented with _goroutine_.

----------------------------------------

**Note:**
Below is an example of running the Lisp interpreter.
If you have a Go compiler, you can try the Lisp right away without any preparations!

```
$ go build lisp.go
$ ./lisp
> (+ 5 6)
11
> (exit 0)
$ 
```

## 2. Features


Some features of the implementation common to lisp-in-dart are:

- It is basically a subset of Emacs Lisp.  However, it is a Lisp-1 with static scoping.
  In other words, it is a Common Lisp-like Lisp-1.

- It makes proper tail calls always.

- A quasi-quotation with backquote will be expanded when macros are expanded.

- A circular list is printed with `...` finitely.

- As an escape sequence within strings, you can use any of:
  `\"` `\\` `\n` `\r` `\f` `\b` `\t` `\v` <!-- " -->

- `(dump)` returns a list of all global variables
  (which does not include special forms such as `lambda` and `setq`
  since they are not variables).

- `*version*` has a value of 3-elements list: the version number, the implementing 
  language, and the name of implementation.

- The special form `(macro` <i>args</i> <i>body</i> `)` evaluates to an anonymous 
  function, which is called a macro expression, in the global environment.
  When you apply the macro expression to a list of actual arguments, the arguments 
  will not be evaluated and the result of the application will be evaluated again.
  A variable bound to a macro expression works as a macro.

- `defmacro` is a macro which binds a variable to a macro expression.

- `defun` is a macro which binds a variable to a lambda expression.

- `let` is a macro which applies a lambda expression to a list of initial values 
  of variables.

- Free symbols within a macro expression will not be captured when the expression 
  is applied (i.e., when the macro is expanded).


By the last feature above, you can avoid variable captures in any macro definitions, 
provided that you use the result of `(gensym)` for any symbol newly introduced to 
the expansion result.
See [lisp-in-dart/IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES ยง5](https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-dart/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md#5).

----------------------------------------

**Note:**
I believe this feature delivers the ideal behavior for a Lisp-1 Lisp, 
which has one name space for both variables and functions, to make use 
of traditional macros.
As a benefit of macros being _partially hygienic_, you can define
[anaphoric macros](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~kc7k-nd/onlispjhtml/anaphoricMacros.html)
by introducing a symbol (`it` in the following example) not by using `(gensym)` 
insistently to the expansion result.

```
> (defmacro aif (test then else)
    `(let ((it ,test))
       (if it ,then ,else) ))
aif
> (aif (+ 7 8 9)
     (print it)
    (print "?"))
24
24
> 
```

----------------------------------------

A restriction not common to lisp-in-dart:


- All numbers are represented by double precision floating point numbers (`float64` in Go).


----------------------------------------

**Note:**
That is why I call it _Light_.
Maybe I should call it _Lite_, but I followed the usage of _Light_
in the famous [Caml Light](http://caml.inria.fr/caml-light/).


```
> *version*
(1.42 "go1.10.1 darwin/amd64" "Nukata Lisp Light")
> 
```

----------------------------------------

In addition, a feature common to
[my first Go Lisp](https://github.com/pkelchte/tiny-lisp) in 2013 is:

- It delivers concurrent computations with goroutines by the special form 
  `(future` _expression_`)` and the function `(force` _promise_`)`.


----------------------------------------

**Note:**
The following example calculates 
[Fibonacci numbers](https://oeis.org/A000045)
concurrently.

It computes `(fib (- n 1))` and `(fib (- n 2))` 
in each goroutine separately and adds the results 
by `(+ (force a) (force b))`.

```
> (defun fib (n)
    (if (<= n 1)
        n
      (let ((a (future (fib (- n 1))))
            (b (future (fib (- n 2)))))
        (+ (force a)
           (force b) ))))
fib
> (fib 10)
55
> (fib 20)
6765
> (fib 30)
832040
> 
```

## 3. Inner Representations of Data

The inner representations of data are the same as the previous implementation 
except for numbers.
All numbers are represented by `float64`.
To represent data of the implemented language (Lisp), native types of the 
implementing language (Go) are used as they are as possible.
They are all treated as `interface{}`.


| Lisp Expression                     | Inner Representation                   |
|:------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| numbers `1`, `2.3`                  | `float64`                              |
| strings `"abc"`, `"hello!\n"`       | `string`                               |
| `t`                                 | `true`                                 |
| `nil`                               | `nil` of `*Cell`                       |
| symbols `x`, `+`                    | `Sym` (user-defined)                   |
| keywords `lambda`, `cond`           | `Sym` (`Iskeyword` flag is true)       |
| lists `(x 1 "2")`, `(y . 3)`        | `Cell` (user-defined)                  |

Below is the definition of the type `Cell`.

```Go
// Cell represents a cons cell.
// &Cell{car, cdr} works as the "cons" operation.
type Cell struct {
	Car interface{}
	Cdr interface{}
}

// Nil is a nil of type *Cell and it represents the empty list.
var Nil *Cell = nil
```

Below is the definition of the type `Sym`.

```Go
// Sym represents a symbol (or an expression keyword) in Lisp.
// &Sym{name, false} constructs a symbol which is not interned yet.
type Sym struct {
	Name      string
	IsKeyword bool
}
```


A `map` is used to intern symbols.
Exclusive locking of `Lock`/`Unlock` is performed here for the sake of 
the concurrent computations with goroutines.

```Go
// symbols is a table of interned symbols.
var symbols = make(map[string]*Sym)

// symLock is an exclusive lock for the table.
var symLock sync.RWMutex

// NewSym2 constructs an interned symbol (or an expression keyword
// if isKeyword is true on its first construction) for name.
func NewSym2(name string, isKeyword bool) *Sym {
	symLock.Lock()
	sym, ok := symbols[name]
	if !ok {
		sym = &Sym{name, isKeyword}
		symbols[name] = sym
	}
	symLock.Unlock()
	return sym
}
```

## 4. Implementations of some major Lisp functions

The core of Lisp interpreter is represented by the structure `Interp`.
It consists of a map for global variables and an exclusive lock for the map.

```Go
// Interp represents a core of the interpreter.
type Interp struct {
	globals map[*Sym]interface{}
	lock    sync.RWMutex
}
```

Each built-in Lisp function is defined with the utility function below.
The `carity` argument takes the arity of the function to be defined.
If the function has `&rest`, the `carity` 
takes `-(`_number of fixed arguments_ ` + 1)`.

```Go
// Def defines a built-in function by giving a name, arity, and body.
func (interp *Interp) Def(name string, carity int,
	body func([]interface{}) interface{}) {
	sym := NewSym(name)
	fnc := NewBuiltInFunc(name, carity, body)
	interp.SetGlobalVar(sym, fnc)
}
```

Below is the head of the function `NewInterp` corresponding to the 
constructor of `Interp`.
This excerpt shows the implementation of five basic functions of Lisp.

```Go
// NewInterp constructs an interpreter and sets built-in functions etc. as
// the global values of symbols within the interpreter.
func NewInterp() *Interp {
	interp := &Interp{globals: make(map[*Sym]interface{})}

	interp.Def("car", 1, func(a []interface{}) interface{} {
		if a[0] == Nil {
			return Nil
		}
		return a[0].(*Cell).Car
	})

	interp.Def("cdr", 1, func(a []interface{}) interface{} {
		if a[0] == Nil {
			return Nil
		}
		return a[0].(*Cell).Cdr
	})

	interp.Def("cons", 2, func(a []interface{}) interface{} {
		return &Cell{a[0], a[1]}
	})

	interp.Def("atom", 1, func(a []interface{}) interface{} {
		if j, ok := a[0].(*Cell); ok && j != Nil {
			return Nil
		}
		return true
	})

	interp.Def("eq", 2, func(a []interface{}) interface{} {
		if a[0] == a[1] { // Cells are compared by address.
			return true
		}
		return Nil
	})
```

The function `dump` takes no arguments and returns a list of all global variables.
Read-locking with `RLock`/`RUnlock`, the implementation of `(dump)` 
reads the keys from the map `globals` held by the `Interp` object and constructs 
a list of them.

```Go
	interp.Def("dump", 0, func(a []interface{}) interface{} {
		interp.lock.RLock()
		defer interp.lock.RUnlock()
		r := Nil
		for key := range interp.globals {
			r = &Cell{key, r}
		}
		return r
	})
```

----------------------------------------

**Note:**
Below is an example of running `(dump)`.

```
> (dump)
(append > cdaar + last or symbol-name prin1 / stringp assoc assq consp caddr def
macro princ < when setcdr truncate - list eq dump apply intern equal not caar fo
rce nreverse _nreverse caadr make-symbol dolist listp * member setcar *version* 
cdr dotimes cdddr cdadr cdar car while _append if >= print exit *gensym-counter*
 length let /= = and letrec <= cons nconc cddr cadr gensym memq defun % cadar ca
aar mod mapcar eql rplaca terpri numberp rplacd atom null identity cddar)
> 
```

Neither `setq` nor `lambda` occur here since they are special forms,
while `defun`, `defmacro` and `let` occur here since they are global 
variables bound to macro expressions.

----------------------------------------

Several functions and macros of Lisp are defined within 
the initialization script `Prelude`.
It runs at the beginning of the `Main` function:

```Go
// Main runs each element of args as a name of Lisp script file.
// It ignores args[0].
// If it does not have args[1] or some element is "-", it begins REPL.
func Main(args []string) int {
	interp := NewInterp()
	ss := strings.NewReader(Prelude)
	if !Run(interp, ss) {
		return 1
	}
	if len(args) < 2 {
		args = []string{args[0], "-"}
	}
	for i, fileName := range args {
		if i == 0 {
			continue
		}
		if fileName == "-" {
			Run(interp, nil)
			fmt.Println("Goodbye")
		} else {
			file, err := os.Open(fileName)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
				return 1
			}
			if !Run(interp, file) {
				return 1
			}
		}
	}
	return 0
}

func main() {
	os.Exit(Main(os.Args))
}
```

Below is the head of `Prelude`.

```Lisp
// Prelude is an initialization script of Lisp.
// Each "~" is replaced by "`" at runtime.
var Prelude = strings.Replace(`
(setq defmacro
      (macro (name args &rest body)
             ~(progn (setq ,name (macro ,args ,@body))
                     ',name)))

(defmacro defun (name args &rest body)
  ~(progn (setq ,name (lambda ,args ,@body))
          ',name))

(defun caar (x) (car (car x)))
(defun cadr (x) (car (cdr x)))
(defun cdar (x) (cdr (car x)))
(defun cddr (x) (cdr (cdr x)))
```

Below is the tail of `Prelude`.
Since "``` ` ```" cannot occur in a raw string literal of Go, "`~`" 
is substituted for it.
Each  "`~`" will be replaced by "``` ` ```" at runtime with `strings.Replace`.

```Lisp
(defmacro dotimes (spec &rest body) ; (dotimes (name count [result]) body...)
  (let ((name (car spec))
        (count (gensym)))
    ~(let ((,name 0)
           (,count ,(cadr spec)))
       (while (< ,name ,count)
         ,@body
         (setq ,name (+ ,name 1)))
       ,@(if (cddr spec)
             ~(,(caddr spec))))))
`, "~", "`", -1)
```
